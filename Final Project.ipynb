    "###The mean squared error measures the average squared difference between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings in the testing set, while the coefficient of determination (R^2) measures the proportion of the variance in the ratings that is explained by the model. In this case, the mean squared error is 2.32 and the R^2 score is -0.48, which suggests that the model is not performing well on the testing data."
